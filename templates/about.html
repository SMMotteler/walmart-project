<div class="center"><p class="boxy bigger">About Cottagecore for All</p></div>
<div class="center"><p class="boxy smaller">This website was created for the 2021 Walmart X Girls Who Code Grace Hopper Scholarship.
It imagines a new feature for Walmart that would allow them to reach out to a younger group of customers who value interpersonal interactions and want to explore new styles of clothing and decor.
<br><br>This feature would take the form of a sort of social media platform where customers could create profiles and curate collections of different Walmart products or projects using Walmart products. These collections can be of any style - I just used the cottagecore style as an example, so in the future multiple styles could be included in the website, and a sorting function could be added that would allow users to look at collections and products of a certain style.
<br><br>While this prototype only has products available for browsing and submission, a future version could have DIY's involving multiple Walmart products or a photo of a room or outfit with links to Walmart products as a way to "get the look".
<br><br>This project, if adopted, would help to bring further value to a new subset of customers by helping them to explore their personal sense of style and providing them with a community of likeminded individuals to participate in.
